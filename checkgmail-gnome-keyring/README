CheckGmail with Gnome Keyring support

The CheckGmail project is hosted at: http://checkgmail.sourceforge.net/

We start with checkgmail's Perl script from the Debian/Ubuntu repositories
(the Debian&Ubuntu scripts are identical as of March 2013, but different from
the versions in CheckGmail's SVN repository).
