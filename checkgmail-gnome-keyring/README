CheckGmail with Gnome Keyring support

The CheckGmail project is hosted at: http://checkgmail.sourceforge.net/

We start with checkgmail's Perl script from the Debian/Ubuntu repositories
(the Debian&Ubuntu scripts are identical as of March 2013, but different from
the versions in CheckGmail's SVN repository).

Should checkgmail be updated in the future, we should be able to apply the
changes below to the new version (this repository will show the diff).

Prerequisites:
– checkgmail's normal dependencies (install it via apt-get to get those)
– Perl Module Passwd::Keyring::Gnome version 0.3001 from:
http://search.cpan.org/~mekk/Passwd-Keyring-Gnome/
Install it with:
perl Build.PL --install_base /some/path
./Build
./Build install
Use it with:
PERL5LIB=/some/path/lib/perl5 perl myscript.pl

Code changes:
– Never use kwallet
Because it was deciding to use it based on its presence in the PATH,
not based on a user option.
– Don't save password to prefs XML file when using gnomekeyring or kwallet
Fix the existing logic: it was correctly not saving from the Preferences
dialog, but was saving to the XML file when the password was entered in the
Login dialog.
– Don't encrypt the password using $mac$uname when using the gnomekeyring
So the user doesn't have to re-enter the password after kernel updates.
– Changed http:// to https:// for all gmail urls using http://
Not sure when those code paths run, so don't know if this breaks anything.
