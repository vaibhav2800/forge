DiceLottery is a program which maps (random) events
from an available source to a desired destination.
For instance you can choose lottery numbers to bet on
by throwing a pair of dice (several times).

This way, you can use an <em>available</em>, <em>fair</em> source of events
which you <em>trust</em> (e.g. a coin, a pair of dice)
and map its outcomes to your desired destination
(e.g. lottery numbers, the winner for a drawing).
</p>

<p>
The program also ensures <em>fairness</em> in the mapping it performs
(your source of events must also be fair of course).
For instance when throwing a coin 3 times in order to choose a day of the week,
the mapping is performed from 8 (=2<sup>3</sup>) to 7 events.
If all 8 would be mapped, then the 7 days of the week
would not have equal probabilities
(and thus the mapping would not be <em>fair</em>).
The program will only map (the first) 7 inputs
and report that the mapping can't be performed
if you enter the 8<sup>th</sup> one.
