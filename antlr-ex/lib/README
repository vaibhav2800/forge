There are (at most) 3 types of .jars needed,
which must be placed in the following subdirectories:

- always/	contains .jars needed for both building and running the project
- development/	contains .jars needed only when building the project
- production/	contains .jars needed only when running the project

Check the README file in each subdirectory for the list of .jars required.
