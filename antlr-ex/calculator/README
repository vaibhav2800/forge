Expression calculator from the ANTLR book

The original grammars are linked from the book to the book's website.
I have added the Java package in the header, and type parameters for HashMap.

I have also changed the WS rule from:
WS  :   (' '|'\t'|'\r'|'\n')+ {skip();} ;
to
WS  :   (' '|'\t')+ {skip();} ;

Although NEWLINE is defined before WS, WS seems to match two or more newlines
(i.e. an empty input line) and the parser reports an error.
I don't *know* but I suspect WS matches instead of NEWLINE
because it can match more input.
