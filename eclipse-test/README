Test runner for Eclipse JUnit run configurations.

1. Eclipse Initial Setup:
– Make a new Eclipse workspace and checkout modules from CVS
– Run each JUnit run configuration once
– Disable Project → Build Automatically
– Project Clean (uncheck ‘start a build immediately’)
– From Eclipse update site http://eclipse.indweb.hu/ install Headless Eclipse
  (check ‘Contact all update sites during install to find required software’)
– close Eclipse

2. Running an automated test:
Use eclipse-test.py.

I suggest structuring your output directories this way:
test-results/
├── run-YYYY.MM.DD-HH:MM:SS/
└── run-YYYY.MM.DD-HH:MM:SS/

by passing this arg to the program: test-results/run-`date +%Y.%m.%d-%H:%M:%S`
This structure is useful for automatically finding & investigating
the results of test runs.
