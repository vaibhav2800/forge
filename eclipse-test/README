Test runner for Eclipse JUnit run configurations.

1. Eclipse Initial Setup:
– Download the Eclipse you use (e.g. Eclipse for RCP and RAP Developers)
– Install the CDT plugin (e.g. Help → Install New Software → Juno →
  CDT Visual C++ Support)
  This is used to make a new workspace, import your projects and build them.
– Run one of the run configurations and save the following files from
  .metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.pde.core/pde-junit/ :

pde-junit/
├── config.ini
├── dev.properties
└── org.eclipse.equinox.simpleconfigurator
    └── bundles.info

  config.ini allows environment variables (but you can't use /../ in a path).
  bundles.info doesn't.
  You could replace the paths with custom strings
  (e.g. ECLTEST_WSP, ECLIPSE_DIR) and replace those before running the tests.
– For each automated test run you can delete the workspace,
  import your projects, and copy this pde-junit/ directory before running.
– Start your test suites once by hand. This may add files & dirs under your
  eclipse/ dir.

2. Running an automated test:
Use eclipse-test.py.

Structuring your output directories like this:
test-results/
├── run-YYYY.MM.DD-HH:MM:SS/
└── run-YYYY.MM.DD-HH:MM:SS/

by passing this arg to the program: test-results/run-`date +%Y.%m.%d-%H:%M:%S`
allows chronological ordering by simple lexicographical ordering.


Old notes below:

Old Eclipse Setup involved:
– checking out modules in a workspace and keeping that workspace
– From Eclipse update site http://eclipse.indweb.hu/ install Headless Eclipse
  (check ‘Contact all update sites during install to find required software’)
– Running each JUnit run configuration once
