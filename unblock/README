Unblock game
============
Horizontal and vertical blocks are placed on a board (of size MxN cells).
A block has length>=2, width=1 and can only move along its length
(e.g. horizontal blocks can only be moved horizontally).
Exactly 1 block (called the ‘target’ block) is special (e.g. different color):
The game objective is to move the target block to the right edge of the board.
The target block must be horizontal.


Board representation as text (e.g. within a file)
=================================================
To represent a MxN board:
ASCII text, M lines with N chars each (detailed below);
lines may have trailing whitespace (spaces and tabs).
Valid characters:
'.' – empty cell
'*' – target block (must be only one and horizontal)
0-9, a-z, A-Z – blocks

The same character may be used for several blocks
if they are not adjacent (up, down, left, right).

Valid board:	Invalid board:
**..A.		**....
.B..A.		....A.
.B..A.		....A.
.BAA..		...AA.

Note: even though the ‘length>=2’ rule would disambiguate the second board
(it has a vertical block of length 2 and a horizontal block of length 2),
the ‘non-adjacency’ rule makes this representation invalid.

When reading a board from a text stream,
empty (or whitespace-only) lines may be present before the board.
The end of the board is signaled by EOF or an empty (or whitespace-only) line.

Lines should be terminated by '\n'.
Implementations may also admit '\r\n', '\r' or a mix of the 3 in the same file,
but only '\n' is guaranteed to work.
